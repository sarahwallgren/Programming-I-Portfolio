  Final Project - Jeopardy Game:
  
For our final project, we decided to do a Jeopardy Game. We decided to have nine categories, with five questions in each. Instead of individually choosing which question in the categories the player wants, the questions will automatically play when a category is choosen. Created by Sarah Wallgren, Morgan Hurley, and Katya Pogodaeva. Project is unfinished. 

Mockup:

  This was the original mockup for the project. It shows how we wanted the categories page to look, but the final look of the categories page is now different. Also the general look of the question pages.

Screenshots:

This is the categories page for the Jeopardy Game. From this page, it leads you to the selected categories questions. We created the GUI in Processing.

I was in charge of creating all of the icons for the game. In these pictures, you can see all of the category icons, and all of the question icons. I used Illustrator to create these icons into .png files to be implemented into the GUI. I also was in charge of creating the questions for the liturature, geography, and sports categories.

This is what our question pages looked like. We employed a click detection to allow the player to choose their answers.

This is the source code for our project. Again, our project is currently unfinished. I wrote all the source code seen above. Most of the game lies inside of the mouseClicked() method.

## Shape Tester:
For this project, we wrote code that allowed the user to imput the dimensions of either a pyramid, box, or sphere and it would return the the surface area of that shape or the volume. 

Source code:

We created a working calculator with a four special functions.

Source code:

This is the class the creates the functionality of the calculator, and where are the buttons are placed.

This gives functionality to the buttons on the calculator.

This is what the calculator looks like running.
